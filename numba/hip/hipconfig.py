"""Configuration options for Numba HIP

Attributes (Controllable via Environment Variables ``NUMBA_HIP_<attribute>``):
    ENABLE_MIDEND_OPT (`bool`):
        Enable midend optimizations.
        Defaults to ``False``.
    OPT_LEVEL (`int`):
        Default level when doing optimizations.
        Defaults to ``3``.
    DEFAULT_ARCH_WITH_FEATURES (`bool`):
        Use a device's default arch with features, e.g. 'gfx90a:xnack-'
        instead of 'gfx90a'. Note that features
        enabled for Numba-generated IR must match those of all
        external dependencies that should be linked in.
        As external dependencies are usually compiled with
        no additional features, e.g. with a simple `--offload-arch=gfx90a`,
        this option defaults to ``False``.
        (Note that `hipcc` per default also specifies the first device's
        architecture without an appended feature set as offload arch.)
    USE_DEVICE_LIB_CACHE (`bool`):
        Store architecture-dependent device library LLVM IR files in a filesystem cache, so that
        the next Numba program can reuse the files from this cache. This caching
        has a significant impact on programs with short runtime, e.g., on
        tests and mini benchmarks. Defaults to ``True``.
    CLEAR_DEVICE_LIB_CACHE (`bool`):
        Clear the filesystem cache used for storing architecture-dependent device library LLVM IR.
        Defaults to ``False``.

Note:
    We currently don't want to break out of subfolder
    ``numba/hip``with the changes that we apply to an
    Numba installation in order to make patching
    and upgrading as frictionless as possible.
